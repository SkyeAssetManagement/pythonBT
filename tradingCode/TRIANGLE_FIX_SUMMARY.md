# Trade Triangle Rendering Fix - Summary

## Problem
Trade triangles were being generated and logged as "drawn" but were not visible on the chart.

## Root Cause
In `vispy_chart_engine.py`, the trade marker shader program was attempting to draw triangles WITHOUT first setting the vertex position and color data in the shader uniforms.

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Shader Data Binding (vispy_chart_engine.py)
**Before:**
```python
# Draw as triangles - every 3 vertices forms a triangle
self.trade_marker_program.draw('triangles')
```

**After:**
```python
# Update shader data before drawing
self.trade_marker_program['a_position'] = self.trade_vertices
self.trade_marker_program['a_color'] = self.trade_colors
if self.projection is not None:
    self.trade_marker_program['u_projection'] = self.projection

# Draw as triangles - every 3 vertices forms a triangle
self.trade_marker_program.draw('triangles')
```

### 2. Enhanced Triangle Visibility (trade_marker_renderer.py)
- **Triangle width:** Increased from 1.5 to 3.0 bars for better visibility
- **Triangle height:** Increased from 0.8x to 1.5x offset for better visibility  
- **Colors:** Changed from 0.8 intensity to 1.0 (bright green/red)

## Verification
- Triangles are now properly rendered and visible on the chart
- Console logs confirm: "Drew X trade vertices as triangles"
- Trade markers appear as:
  - **Long Entry:** Green triangle pointing UP (below price)
  - **Long Exit:** Red triangle pointing DOWN (above price)
  - **Short Entry:** Red triangle pointing DOWN (above price)
  - **Short Exit:** Green triangle pointing UP (below price)

## Files Modified
1. `src/dashboard/vispy_chart_engine.py` - Fixed shader data binding
2. `src/dashboard/trade_marker_renderer.py` - Enhanced triangle visibility

## Test Command
```bash
python main.py ES simpleSMA --useDefaults --start_date "2020-01-01"
```

## Status
âœ… **FIXED** - Trade triangles are now visible and rendering correctly
