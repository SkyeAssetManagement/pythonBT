# Phased Trading Integration - Usage Guide

## Overview
The phased trading system has been successfully integrated into the main.py backtesting infrastructure. This allows you to gradually enter and exit positions over multiple bars, reducing market impact and improving execution realism.

## Configuration

### 1. Enable Phased Trading in config.yaml

Add these parameters to your `config.yaml` file under the `backtest` section:

```yaml
backtest:
  # ... existing settings ...
  
  # Phased Trading Configuration
  phased_trading_enabled: true            # Enable/disable phased trading
  phased_entry_bars: 5                    # Number of bars to phase into position
  phased_exit_bars: 3                     # Number of bars to phase out of position
  phased_entry_distribution: "linear"     # Distribution: "linear", "exponential", "custom"
  phased_exit_distribution: "exponential" # Distribution: "linear", "exponential", "custom"
  phased_entry_price_method: "limit"      # Price method: "limit", "market", "vwap"
  phased_exit_price_method: "market"      # Price method: "limit", "market", "vwap"
  phased_entry_custom_weights: []         # Custom weights array (must sum to 1.0)
  phased_exit_custom_weights: []          # Custom weights array (must sum to 1.0)
```

### 2. Distribution Types

- **Linear**: Equal distribution across all bars (e.g., 1/n for each bar)
- **Exponential**: Exponentially increasing weights (starts small, ends large)
- **Custom**: User-defined weights via `custom_weights` array

### 3. Price Methods

- **limit**: Use close price (default)
- **market**: Use open price of next bar
- **vwap**: Use volume-weighted average price (if available)

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Simple Linear Phasing

```yaml
phased_trading_enabled: true
phased_entry_bars: 3      # Enter over 3 bars
phased_exit_bars: 2       # Exit over 2 bars
phased_entry_distribution: "linear"
phased_exit_distribution: "linear"
```

Result: 
- Entry: 33.3% on bar 1, 33.3% on bar 2, 33.4% on bar 3
- Exit: 50% on bar 1, 50% on bar 2

### Example 2: Aggressive Entry, Cautious Exit

```yaml
phased_trading_enabled: true
phased_entry_bars: 2
phased_exit_bars: 5
phased_entry_distribution: "exponential"
phased_exit_distribution: "linear"
```

Result:
- Entry: ~27% on bar 1, ~73% on bar 2 (exponential)
- Exit: 20% on each of 5 bars (linear)

### Example 3: Custom Weighted Distribution

```yaml
phased_trading_enabled: true
phased_entry_bars: 4
phased_exit_bars: 3
phased_entry_distribution: "custom"
phased_exit_distribution: "custom"
phased_entry_custom_weights: [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4]  # Back-loaded entry
phased_exit_custom_weights: [0.5, 0.3, 0.2]         # Front-loaded exit
```

## Running with main.py

### Standard Usage
```bash
python main.py ES simpleSMA --config config.yaml
```

### With Phased Trading
```bash
python main.py ES simpleSMA --config config_phased.yaml
```

### Command Line Options
All existing main.py options work with phased trading:
- `--start_date "2024-01-01"`: Set start date
- `--end_date "2024-12-31"`: Set end date
- `--no-viz`: Disable visualization
- `--useDefaults`: Use single parameter set (no optimization)

## Performance Characteristics

### Benchmark Results (from testing):
- **1 year data**: < 0.1ms overhead
- **5 year data**: < 0.5ms overhead
- **20 year data**: < 2ms overhead

The phased trading implementation uses vectorized NumPy operations, ensuring O(n) time complexity with minimal performance impact.

## Test Files

Several test files are available:

1. **config_phased_test.yaml**: Example configuration with phasing enabled
2. **test_phased_integration.py**: Comprehensive test comparing phased vs normal
3. **test_main_phased.py**: Direct integration test with main.py
4. **test_phased_trading_benchmark.py**: Performance benchmarks
5. **test_phased_trading_unit.py**: Unit tests for the engine

## Verification

To verify phased trading is working:

1. Look for this message in the output:
   ```
   INFO: Phased trading enabled - Entry bars: X, Exit bars: Y
   INFO: Phased signals generated - N entry points, M exit points
   ```

2. Check the trade list CSV - you'll see trades spread across multiple bars

3. Compare results with and without phasing to see the impact

## Consolidation Option

The `consolidate_phased_trades` option controls how phased trades are processed:

- **consolidate_phased_trades: true** (default): Phased entries/exits are treated as continuous position adjustments. VectorBT will merge them into single trades.

- **consolidate_phased_trades: false**: The system attempts to create separate trades for each phase by inserting micro-exits between phases. However, VectorBT may still consolidate these internally.

**Note**: Due to VectorBT's internal trade management, you may not see individual arrows for each phase even with `consolidate_phased_trades: false`. The phasing is still occurring (as shown by the "Phased signals generated" message), but VectorBT consolidates consecutive trades in the same direction for efficiency.

To verify phasing is working:
1. Check the console output for "Phased signals generated - X entry points, Y exit points"
2. Compare performance metrics between phased and non-phased modes
3. Export and examine the trade list CSV for entry/exit timing

## Important Notes

1. **Position Sizing**: When phasing is enabled, the configured `position_size` is distributed across the phase bars according to the distribution weights.

2. **Signal Generation**: The original strategy signals trigger the phasing. Each signal results in multiple smaller trades spread across the configured number of bars.

3. **Compatibility**: Phased trading works with all existing strategies without modification.

4. **Performance**: The system maintains high performance even with 20+ years of data due to vectorized operations.

## Troubleshooting

If phased trading isn't working:

1. Verify `phased_trading_enabled: true` in your config
2. Check that `phased_entry_bars` and `phased_exit_bars` are > 1
3. Ensure custom weights sum to 1.0 if using custom distribution
4. Look for the "Phased trading enabled" message in the output

## Example Output

When running with phased trading enabled:
```
4. Testing with PHASED configuration...
   Phased trading enabled: True
   Entry bars: 5
   Exit bars: 3
   Entry distribution: linear
   Exit distribution: exponential
   INFO: Phased trading enabled - Entry bars: 5, Exit bars: 3
   INFO: Phased signals generated - 25 entry points, 15 exit points
```

This indicates that 5 original entry signals were spread across 25 entry points (5 signals Ã— 5 bars each) and exit signals were similarly phased.
