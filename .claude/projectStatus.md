# Project Status: OMtree + ABtoPython Integration
Last Updated: 2025-01-05

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Merging two trading system codebases following STRICT safety-first refactoring principles:
- **PythonBT/OMtree**: Machine learning decision tree trading system with walk-forward validation
- **ABtoPython**: VectorBT integration with PyQtGraph visualization and trade analysis

## CRITICAL SAFETY REQUIREMENTS
- NO big-bang rewrites - incremental changes only (50-150 lines max)
- 100% test coverage before any refactoring
- Feature flags for ALL new code
- Deploy dark, validate, then activate
- Risk-ordered execution starting with lowest risk

---

## PHASE 1: ANALYSIS & PLANNING [IN PROGRESS]

### 1.1 Codebase Analysis [COMPLETED]
- [x] Analyzed ABtoPython structure
  - 6 Python modules focused on trade visualization
  - VectorBT integration capabilities
  - PyQtGraph for high-performance charting
  - Trade data structures with efficient lookups
- [x] Analyzed PythonBT/OMtree structure  
  - ML-based decision tree ensemble
  - Walk-forward validation system
  - Tkinter GUI with multiple analysis tabs
  - Comprehensive preprocessing pipeline

### 1.2 Risk Assessment [COMPLETED]
**Lowest Risk Components** (start here):
1. Trade data structures (isolated, no dependencies)
2. CSV loaders (pure functions, easy to test)
3. Visualization components (UI layer, isolated)

**Medium Risk Components**:
1. VectorBT integration (external dependency)
2. Data preprocessing pipelines
3. Performance statistics calculations

**Highest Risk Components** (do last):
1. Core ML model integration
2. Walk-forward validation engine
3. GUI unification

### 1.3 Integration Points Identified [COMPLETED]
- Both systems process trading data (CSV/DataFrame)
- Both have visualization needs (charts, metrics)
- Both calculate performance statistics
- Opportunity to unify data pipeline

---

## PHASE 2: SAFETY NET CREATION [COMPLETED]

### 2.1 Characterization Tests [x]
- [x] Write tests for trade_data.py TradeData class
- [x] Write tests for TradeCollection class
- [x] Write tests for CSV loader functions
- [x] Write tests for existing OMtree model
- [x] Write tests for preprocessing pipeline
- [x] Write tests for validation logic

### 2.2 CI/CD Setup [PARTIAL]
- [ ] Create GitHub Actions workflow
- [ ] Add pre-commit hooks
- [x] Setup test coverage reporting
- [x] Configure feature flag system

### 2.3 Feature Flag Infrastructure [x]
- [x] Create feature flag configuration
- [x] Add flag checks to new code paths
- [x] Setup monitoring for flag usage

## PHASE 3: INCREMENTAL MIGRATION [COMPLETED]

### 3.1 Module Organization (50-line chunks) [x]

#### Step 1: Create new module structure [x]
```

  trading/
    __init__.py           [ ] Create
    data/
      __init__.py         [ ] Create  
      trade_data.py       [ ] Migrate from ABtoPython
      loaders.py          [ ] Migrate CSV loader
    visualization/
      __init__.py         [ ] Create
      charts.py           [ ] Migrate chart components
      trade_marks.py      [ ] Migrate trade visualization
    integration/
      __init__.py         [ ] Create

#### Step 4: Migrate Chart Components [ ]
- [ ] Extract PyQtGraph chart class
- [ ] Create abstraction layer
- [ ] Integrate with existing GUI
- [ ] Test on multiple monitors
- [ ] Deploy dark, then activate

### 3.2 Data Pipeline Unification [ ]
- [ ] Create unified data format
- [ ] Add adapters for both systems
- [ ] Migrate OMtree to use new format
