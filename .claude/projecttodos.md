# Project TODOs - VectorBT Pro Phased Entry Implementation

## Core VectorBT Pro Integration Tasks

### Phase 1: Volume-Based Execution Implementation
- [ ] Implement VWAP execution pricing using native VectorBT Pro features
- [ ] Create volume participation rate calculator using vectorized operations
- [ ] Add volume threshold checking for execution feasibility
- [ ] Integrate volume-based execution with accumulate=True parameter

### Phase 2: Time-Based Execution Implementation
- [ ] Implement TWAP execution pricing using native VectorBT Pro features
- [ ] Create time-interval execution scheduler using pure array processing
- [ ] Add time-based fallback when volume insufficient
- [ ] Integrate time-based execution with accumulate=True parameter

### Phase 3: Hybrid Execution System
- [ ] Combine volume and time-based approaches with preference settings
- [ ] Implement execution plan pre-calculation for O(1) performance
- [ ] Add dynamic switching between volume/time modes
- [ ] Create unified execution interface for both methods

### Phase 4: Pure Array Processing Optimization
- [ ] Ensure all execution calculations use vectorized NumPy operations
- [ ] Implement two-sweep architecture: signals -> execution plans -> results
- [ ] Verify O(1) scaling performance with large datasets
- [ ] Add execution timing benchmarks and performance monitoring

### Phase 5: Configuration and Testing
- [ ] Update config.yaml with final VectorBT Pro execution settings
- [ ] Create comprehensive test suite for phased entry strategies
- [ ] Add performance validation against pure array benchmarks
- [ ] Document VectorBT Pro integration patterns and best practices

## Technical Implementation Notes
- Use native `data.hlc3` property instead of custom formulas
- Leverage VectorBT Pro `Portfolio.from_signals(accumulate=True)` for position scaling
- Implement volume/time calculations using pure NumPy array broadcasting
- Maintain O(1) performance through pre-calculated execution plans
