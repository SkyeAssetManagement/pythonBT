## Known Issues

### High Priority
- Memory usage increases over time in long sessions
- SMA strategy can generate 1000+ trades with short periods
- Windows-specific file paths in some scripts

### Medium Priority
- PyQt6 not supported (requires PyQt5)
- Large datasets (>10M bars) may cause crashes
- Config changes require restart

### Low Priority
- No keyboard shortcuts
- Limited color theme options
- No undo/redo for operations
