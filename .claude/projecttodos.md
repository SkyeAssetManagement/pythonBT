# PyQtGraph Trading Chart - TIMESTAMP ISSUE FIXED! ✅

## Issue Resolution (2025-09-22)

### Root Cause Found and Fixed
The column mapping in `launch_pyqtgraph_with_selector.py` was incorrectly renaming the 'Date' column to 'DateTime' BEFORE combining it with the 'Time' column. This caused timestamps to lose their time component.

### The Fix
```python
# BEFORE (BUG):
column_mapping = {
    'Date': 'DateTime',  # This renamed Date to DateTime WITHOUT Time!
    ...
}

# AFTER (FIXED):
column_mapping = {
    # 'Date': 'DateTime',  # REMOVED - Date needs to combine with Time first
    ...
}
```

### Verification
- Timestamps now correctly show as "2021-01-03 17:01:00" instead of "2021-01-03 00:00:00"
- X-axis displays actual times (17:01:00, 17:02:00, etc.)
- Trade list shows complete DateTime with both date and time
- Strategy execution receives proper timestamps

## All Issues Resolved ✅

1. ✅ **SELL/SHORT text contrast** - Fixed with lighter red color (255,120,120)
2. ✅ **X-axis timestamps** - Now shows actual times from data
3. ✅ **Trade list timestamps** - Shows complete date and time

## Files Modified

### Critical Fix
- `launch_pyqtgraph_with_selector.py` (line 167) - Removed 'Date' from column mapping

- `src/trading/visualization/pyqtgraph_range_bars_final.py` - Added timestamp debugging
- `src/trading/strategies/base.py` - Enhanced timestamp logging

## Next Steps

### Production Ready
- Remove remaining debug print statements
- Add proper logging configuration
- Performance optimization for large datasets

### Future Enhancements
- Add timezone support
- Implement real-time data feed
- Add more trading strategies
