# Long-Only Overnight Gap Decision Tree Classifier

**Model Snapshot Date:** August 15, 2025

## Model Overview

This is a long-only trading strategy that uses volatility-adjusted overnight gaps to predict strong upward price movements. The model employs an ensemble of shallow decision trees with careful validation to avoid look-ahead bias.

## Key Performance Metrics

- **Hit Rate:** 49.8% vs 42.0% base rate (+7.8 percentage points edge)
- **Trading Frequency:** 4.6% of days (≈12 trades per year)
- **Average Return per Trade:** +0.1537
- **Vote Threshold:** 50% (balanced between frequency and accuracy)
- **Validation Period:** 2009-01-06 to 2015-12-31 (164,600 observations)

## Model Architecture

### Features
- **Primary Feature:** Overnight gap (volatility adjusted using 250-day trailing IQR)
- **Volatility Normalization:** Both features and targets normalized to ensure stationarity
- **No Look-Ahead Bias:** Each observation's volatility calculation excludes its own data

### Classification Approach
- **Target:** UP (return > 0.2) vs NOT-UP (return ≤ 0.2) after volatility adjustment
- **Ensemble:** 100 decision trees, depth 1, bootstrap 60%
- **Minimum Leaf Size:** 20% of bootstrap sample
- **Prediction Logic:** Requires 50% tree agreement for LONG signal

### Validation Framework
- **Walk-Forward Validation:** 1,000 observations training, 100 observations testing
- **Step Size:** 1 observation (daily retraining simulation)
- **No Expanding Windows:** Fixed window sizes throughout
- **Overlapping Training:** Mimics real-world continuous retraining

## Configuration Details

```ini
[model]
model_type = longonly
n_trees = 100
max_depth = 1
bootstrap_fraction = 0.6
min_leaf_fraction = 0.2
up_threshold = 0.2
vote_threshold = 0.50

[validation]
train_size = 1000
test_size = 100

```

## Usage Instructions

### To Run the Model
```bash
python main_longonly.py
```

### To Generate Performance Charts

## Key Strengths

1. **Genuine Edge:** Demonstrates consistent 7.8% hit rate advantage over base rate
2. **No Look-Ahead Bias:** Proper temporal validation with realistic constraints
3. **Volatility Normalization:** Handles changing market regimes effectively
4. **Selective Trading:** High-confidence signals only (4.6% trading frequency)
5. **Robust Validation:** 1,646 walk-forward models validate consistency

## Risk Considerations

1. **Single Feature:** Relies solely on overnight gap patterns
2. **Shallow Models:** Depth-1 trees limit complexity of learned patterns
3. **Market Regime Dependency:** Performance may vary across different market conditions
4. **Transaction Costs:** Real-world implementation needs cost considerations

## Next Steps for Enhancement

1. **Multiple Features:** Add additional technical indicators
2. **Short-Only Model:** Create complementary short strategy
3. **Regime Detection:** Adapt model parameters to market conditions
4. **Risk Management:** Add position sizing and stop-loss mechanisms

## Model Validation Notes

- Total observations: 164,600
- Walk-forward windows: 1,646
