## Model Evolution Summary

### Development Path
1. **Single Feature (Overnight only):** 7.8% edge, 4.6% frequency
2. **Two Features (Overnight + 3day):** 5.9% edge, 2.6% frequency
3. **Increased Trees (100 → 200):** 5.1% edge, 2.6% frequency
4. **Reduced Min Leaf (20% → 10%):** 11.7% edge, 3.9% frequency ⭐

### Key Insights
- Adding the 3day feature improved selectivity
- Reducing min leaf fraction significantly improved edge
- 200 trees with 10% min leaf provides optimal balance
- 20-day step validation enables efficient testing

## Risk Considerations

1. **Model Limitations:**
   - Single bad year (2012) shows regime sensitivity
   - Relies on two technical features only
   - Shallow trees limit pattern complexity

2. **Implementation Risks:**
   - Transaction costs not modeled
   - Slippage and market impact not considered
   - Model requires regular retraining

3. **Market Regime Dependency:**
   - Performance varies across market conditions
   - One year (2012) showed significant losses
   - Model recovered strongly in subsequent years

## Recommendations

1. **Production Use:**
   - Implement with appropriate position sizing
   - Monitor for regime changes
   - Consider transaction cost impact

2. **Further Development:**
   - Add regime detection capabilities
   - Explore additional features
   - Implement risk management overlays

This model represents the optimal balance of predictive power, computational efficiency, and robustness identified through systematic walk-forward validation testing.
