# OMtree Pipeline Audit Report

## Executive Summary
Comprehensive audit of the OMtree decision tree ensemble trading model pipeline was conducted to identify any logic inconsistencies. The audit covered data preprocessing, normalization, model training, prediction logic, and P&L calculations.

## Audit Findings

### 1. Data Preprocessing & Normalization ✅ CONSISTENT

**Finding**: The preprocessing pipeline correctly handles volatility normalization.

**Details**:
- `OMtree_preprocessing.py` uses a config-driven approach for normalization
- Line 7: Default config path still references 'config_longonly.ini' instead of 'OMtree_config.ini'
- **MINOR ISSUE**: Should update to `config_path='OMtree_config.ini'`
- Volatility adjustment uses trailing IQR with configurable window (currently 120 days)
- Both features and targets can be independently normalized via config flags

### 2. Train/Test Split Logic ✅ CONSISTENT

**Finding**: Walk-forward validation correctly prevents data leakage.

**Details**:
- `OMtree_validation.py` lines 45-51: Proper sequential split
- Training window: observations [train_start_idx : train_end_idx]
- Test window: observations [test_start_idx : test_end_idx]
- No overlap between training and testing data
- Volatility window correctly accounted for in minimum start index (line 103)

### 3. Normalization Consistency ✅ CONSISTENT

**Finding**: Normalization is applied consistently to both training and test data.

**Details**:
- Lines 66-70: Both train and test data use the same preprocessed columns
- Line 73: Raw returns are correctly preserved for P&L calculation
- Lines 160-161: Both raw and normalized values are stored for reference

### 4. Prediction Thresholds & Voting Logic ✅ CONSISTENT

**Finding**: Model prediction logic is correctly implemented.

**Details**:
- `OMtree_model.py` lines 40-52: Binary labels created based on target_threshold
- Lines 134-137: Vote threshold correctly applied for trade signals
- Long-only: Profitable when return > target_threshold
- Short-only: Profitable when return < -target_threshold
- Voting requires >= vote_threshold fraction of trees to agree

### 5. P&L Calculation Logic ✅ CONSISTENT

**Finding**: P&L calculations correctly use raw (non-normalized) returns.

**Details**:
- `OMtree_validation.py` line 160: Uses `test_y_raw` for P&L
- Lines 226-233: Correct directional P&L calculation
  - Long trades: profit = positive returns
  - Short trades: profit = -negative returns (inverted)
- Monthly P&L and Sharpe ratio use raw returns (lines 272-282)

### 6. Model Type Consistency ✅ CONSISTENT

**Finding**: Model type (longonly/shortonly) is handled consistently throughout.

**Details**:
- Lines 145-148: Actual profitability correctly calculated per model type
- Lines 226-233: P&L correctly inverted for short trades
- Model type validated in `OMtree_model.py` lines 23-24

## Issues Found

### Minor Issues (Non-Critical)

1. **Config Path Reference**
   - Location: `OMtree_preprocessing.py` line 7
   - Issue: Default path still references 'config_longonly.ini'
   - Fix: Change to `config_path='OMtree_config.ini'`

2. **Config Path in Model**
   - Location: `OMtree_model.py` line 8 (already fixed)
   - Status: ✅ Already corrected to 'OMtree_config.ini'

### Logic Verification Results

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Data Loading | ✅ Pass | CSV loaded correctly |
| Preprocessing | ✅ Pass | Volatility normalization working |
| Train/Test Split | ✅ Pass | No data leakage |
| Model Training | ✅ Pass | Bootstrap sampling correct |
| Prediction Logic | ✅ Pass | Voting threshold applied |
| P&L Calculation | ✅ Pass | Uses raw returns |
| Directional Logic | ✅ Pass | Long/short handled correctly |
| Walk-Forward | ✅ Pass | Sequential validation |

## Recommendations

1. **Update Default Config Paths**: Change remaining 'config_longonly.ini' references to 'OMtree_config.ini' for consistency

2. **Consider Adding Validation**:
   - Add check for minimum volatility window data before starting validation
   - Validate that selected_features exist in feature_columns

3. **Performance Note**: Current config shows:
   - 4 features selected (Overnight, 3day, Last10, First20)
   - Previous optimal was 2 features (Overnight, 3day)
   - Consider reverting to 2-feature configuration for better performance

## Conclusion

The OMtree pipeline is **logically consistent** with no critical issues found. The model correctly:
- Prevents data leakage in walk-forward validation
- Applies normalization consistently
- Calculates P&L using raw returns
- Handles long/short strategies appropriately
- Implements voting thresholds correctly

Only minor configuration reference updates are recommended for full consistency.
