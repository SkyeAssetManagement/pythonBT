# GUI Improvements Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

All requested GUI improvements have been successfully implemented:

### 1. ✅ Chart Auto-Resize
- Charts now automatically resize to fit the window
- Implemented using PIL's `thumbnail()` method with window resize event handling
- Charts maintain aspect ratio while fitting within available space

### 2. ✅ Renamed "Run Validation" to "Run Walk Forward"
- All references updated throughout the GUI
- Tab renamed from "Run Validation" to "Run Walk Forward"
- Button text changed to "Run Walk Forward"
- Console messages updated to reflect new terminology

### 3. ✅ Walk-Forward Honors Feature/Target Selection
- Validation now properly uses selected features from Model Config tab
- Configuration is saved to `OMtree_config.ini` with `selected_features` field
- `OMtree_validation.py` reads and uses the selected features (lines 16-19)
- Verified with test script - all features are properly recognized

### 4. ✅ Configuration History Tables
- Implemented comprehensive configuration management system
- Data Config History Table shows:
  - CSV File, Validation Start/End dates
  - Number of features and targets
  - Timestamp of when saved
- Model Config History Table shows:
  - Selected features (abbreviated list)
  - Target column
  - Model type and key parameters
  - Timestamp of when saved
- Both tables display in reverse chronological order (newest first)

### 5. ✅ Project Management in File Menu
- File menu reorganized for project-based operations:
  - "Save Project" - saves current configuration as project
  - "Save Project As..." - saves with custom name
  - "Load Project" - loads saved project configurations
- Projects stored in `projects/` directory as JSON files
- Each project links to specific data and model configuration IDs

### 6. ✅ Auto-Save on Walk-Forward Run
- Configurations automatically saved to history when running walk-forward
- Both data and model configs are saved with timestamps
- User receives confirmation in console that configs were saved
- Ensures reproducibility of all walk-forward runs

## Technical Implementation

### New Files Created:
1. **`config_manager.py`** - Configuration management system with UUID-based tracking
2. **`OMtree_gui_v2.py`** - Enhanced GUI with all requested features

### Configuration Storage:
- `data_configs.json` - Stores data configuration history
- `model_configs.json` - Stores model configuration history  
- `projects/` directory - Stores project files

### Key Features:
- UUID-based configuration tracking for unique identification
- JSON format for easy portability and version control
- History limited to last 50 configurations to prevent bloat
- Pandas DataFrames for efficient table display

## Verification

All functionality has been tested and verified:
- Configuration test script confirms selected features are properly stored
- GUI launch test confirms all components are present
- Walk-forward validation properly reads selected features from config

## Current State

The GUI is fully functional with:
- Comprehensive configuration management
- Visual timeline showing data splits
- Auto-resizing charts
- Walk-forward validation with proper feature selection
- Complete project save/load functionality
- Configuration history tracking with auto-save

All requested improvements have been successfully implemented and tested.
